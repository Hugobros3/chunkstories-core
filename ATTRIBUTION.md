# Attribution

Not everything asset here is made by me. I did by best not using assets under copyright use, and in this file I'll try to credit the author of any files I am using. Some files I do not know how I got them, thus I don't know if I can even use them and so they server only as placeholder.

### By default (most assets)

Unless state otherwise, consider any file in this repo made by me ( Hugo "Gobrose" Devillers ), in doubt, if it smells like programmer art, it most definitly is mine. This include most of the voxel textures and the crappy sound effects.

### Robobo1221's shader work

To help implement screen-space reflections correctly, I used the raytrace() function from [Robobo1221's shaderpack](https://github.com/robobo1221/robobo1221Shaders), with his permission.

### Fonts

I use the Liberation font-family, I included all the licensing information at font/liberation_info/

### Music

* sounds/music/menu.ogg - I included some test song [Anate0](https://soundcloud.com/anate0) made for me.

### Sound effects

### Unknown license holder / Unlicensed / Placeholder

These have to go, better soon than later.
